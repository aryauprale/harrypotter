          <h1 class="title" style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> <u> The Fourth Book</u></h1>
          <p style="color:rgb(231, 240, 255)"><br>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000) is the fourth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.<br><br> It's a pivotal installment that marks a significant shift in the tone of the series, moving away from the more whimsical and lighthearted atmosphere of the earlier books and into darker and more mature territory.<br><br> The book is filled with action, danger, and deeper themes of identity, loyalty, and the rise of evil forces.

            <br><br>Here’s a detailed breakdown of the story, themes, and major events in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire:
            
            <br><br> Plot Summary:
            <br><br> The story begins with Harry attending the Quidditch World Cup with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. While there, the camp is attacked by Death Eaters, followers of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort. <br><br>This event sets the stage for the increasingly ominous events to come. <br><br>The Dark Mark, a symbol of Voldemort's followers, is seen in the sky, signaling the return of dark forces to the wizarding world.
            
            <br><br>The Triwizard Tournament:
            <br><br>Upon returning to Hogwarts, the school is chosen to host the Triwizard Tournament, a magical competition between three wizarding schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons Academy, and Durmstrang Institute. The tournament involves three dangerous tasks, each designed to test the competitors' magical abilities, courage, and resourcefulness.
            
            <br><br>Students aged 17 and above are eligible to compete, but somehow, Harry’s name is mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire as a fourth competitor—despite Harry being underage (only 14) and not having put his name in. This sparks tension, as many believe that someone is trying to undermine the integrity of the competition. <br><br>Harry is forced to compete against his will, and the three other champions are:

            <br><br>Cedric Diggory (Hogwarts)
            <br><br>Victor Krum (Durmstrang)
            <br><br>Fleur Delacour (Beauxbatons)
            <br><br>Throughout the tournament, Harry faces dangerous challenges, including a dragon, a maze full of magical creatures, and a lake filled with deadly creatures. With the help of his friends, Harry survives each trial, though he faces many setbacks and the constant pressure of being an unwilling participant.
            
            <br><br>The Return of Voldemort:
            <br><br>The final task of the tournament is a maze, and when Harry and Cedric reach the Triwizard Cup at the same time, they decide to take it together and share the victory. However, when they touch the Cup, it turns out to be a Portkey, which transports them to a graveyard where Lord Voldemort and his followers are waiting.
            
            <br><br>Voldemort, whose body had been destroyed years ago when he tried to kill Harry as a baby, is reborn in the graveyard using dark magic. Cedric is murdered, and Harry is forced to witness the rebirth of the Dark Lord. Voldemort uses Harry's blood to regain his full power, making Harry an unwilling participant in his return to power.
            
            <br><br>During the encounter, Voldemort and Harry engage in a duel, but Harry’s connection to Voldemort (through the scar on his forehead) plays a crucial role. As the wands of Harry and Voldemort connect in a rare phenomenon known as Priori Incantatem, the spirits of those Voldemort killed—his parents and Cedric—help Harry escape, returning him to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. </p>
