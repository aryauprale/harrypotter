          <p style="color:rgb(231, 240, 255)"><br>Hello! My name is Arya Uprale and I am a passionate student with a huge love for reading.<br><br> I have been figuring out how to be a good student, balance work, and somehow fit in my other hobbies.<br><br> I thrive on creativity, connection, and making things happen —<br><br> whether that's through coding or just sharing a little bit of joy through volunteering.<br><br>
            I believe in reading being a caveat to living a healthier life,<br><br> and I'm always excited to learn, grow, and connect with like-minded people.<br><br> When I'm not coding, you can find me exercising or reading or volunteering.<br><br> Reading books has always been an important part of my life<br><br> because it has given me the knowledge to understand things in the world without having much experience in life.<br><br> There's so much to do in life and it's so hard to have a great work-life balance.<br><br> Lately, reading has been the last thing to do on my list and I don't want my life to be as such.<br><br> I used to never have problems with spelling things or writing essays because of how much I used to read.<br><br> I am on my journey to read much more and I hope some of you will try to read more as well.<br><br> I hope my website is a way for people to connect to their nostalgic past through remembering Harry Potter.<br><br>If you're interested in collaborating, chatting, or just want to connect, <br><br>don't be shy — I love meeting new people and exploring exciting opportunities!</p>

          <p style="color:rgb(215, 252,238)"><br>Harry Potter made up my entire childhood.<br><br>I was so enthralled with the wizarding world and following Harry Potter's fight against Voldemort.<br><br> Initially, he did not have much umderstanding of who Voldemort was.<br><br> As he grew older, he had to face his adversities and fears.<br><br>I really connected with how much more serious life became for him as Voldemort started to destroy the world.<br><br> Honestly, Harry Potter has been more than just a story to me;<br><br> it has been a journey of magic, friendship, and self-discovery.<br><br> Millions of people have always felt the same way about the series. <br><br>There may never again be a time where so many people read the same book<br><br> and could connect with each other and the wizarding world.<br><br>I remember growing up and talking to many people about all the books we had read.<br><br>Reading was a huge part of our lives and we all shared the many different emotions we felt while reading.<br><br>While reading Harry Potter I think I identified with the aspects of friendship and loyalty <br><br>within the story because they reflected my own relationships with others.<br><br> Overall, Harry Potter gave me a great sense of belonging<br><br> and taught me many moral lessons that gave me enough inspiration to overcome my own challenges.<br></p>
