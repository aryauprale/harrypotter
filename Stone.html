            <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (released in the UK as Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone) is the first book in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series.<br><br> It introduces readers to the magical world of wizards and witches through the eyes of Harry Potter, a young boy who discovers on his 11th birthday that he is not just any ordinary boy—he’s a wizard.<br><br> The book sets the stage for Harry's journey into the wizarding world and the challenges he will face as he grows up.<br><br> The story begins with Harry Potter, a seemingly ordinary 11-year-old boy living with his cruel aunt and uncle, the Dursleys.<br><br> Harry has been told by the Dursleys that he is unwanted and unloved, having been raised in a cupboard under the stairs after the tragic deaths of his parents.<br><br> Harry has no idea of his true origins, other than that his parents died in a car crash when he was just a baby.<br><br>

                On his 11th birthday, Harry receives a letter from a mysterious sender, inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br><br> He learns that his parents were famous wizards, and that he survived a deadly attack by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when he was a baby.<br><br> This event left him with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.<br><br> Harry is introduced to the wizarding world through the help of Hagrid, a giant of a man who works as a gamekeeper at Hogwarts.<br><br>
                
                At Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House, where he meets two new best friends: Hermione Granger, a brilliant and determined Muggle-born witch, and Ron Weasley, the youngest son of a large wizarding family.<br><br> Together, they begin their education in magic, making new friends, and, in Harry’s case, discovering that he is famous in the wizarding world.<br><br>
                
                The students also learn about the Sorcerer’s Stone, a magical object created by the legendary alchemist Nicolas Flamel.<br><br> The Stone has the power to grant immortality by producing the Elixir of Life, and it can turn any metal into gold. It is kept in a hidden chamber at Hogwarts, protected by powerful enchantments. </p>
