The story follows a young boy, Harry Potter, who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard. He learns that he is famous in the wizarding world for surviving an attack from the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when he was just a baby. This attack left Harry with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead and left Voldemort nearly powerless.
                The series spans Harry's years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he makes close friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, and faces numerous challenges. The books follow his journey to uncover the truth about his past, his connection to Voldemort, and his destiny to defeat the dark wizard once and for all.
                As Harry grows up, the conflict between the forces of good (led by Harry, his friends, and their allies) and the forces of evil (led by Voldemort and his followers, called Death Eaters) intensifies. Throughout the series, Harry and his friends deal with themes of friendship, bravery, love, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil. The series is also known for its rich world-building, magical creatures, spells, and the exploration of complex moral and ethical issues.
                The seven books are:
                Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (Philosopher’s Stone in some countries)
                Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
                Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
                Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
                Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
                Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
                Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
                The series has had a significant impact on popular culture and has been adapted into a successful film series, as well as numerous other spin-offs, merchandise, and theme park attractions.

            <p style="color:rgb(156, 216, 176)">J.K. Rowling is a British author best known for writing the Harry Potter series, one of the most successful and beloved book franchises in modern literary history. Rowling's rise to fame was a remarkable one, as she went from living in relative poverty to becoming one of the wealthiest and most influential authors in the world.
              Early Life of J.K. Rowling
              Joanne Rowling was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. She studied French at the University of Exeter and worked various jobs, including as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International, before focusing on writing. The idea for Harry Potter reportedly came to her during a train ride from Manchester to London in 1990. By the time she finished the manuscript for the first book, she had faced multiple personal and financial struggles, including the death of her mother and a period of depression.
              The Harry Potter Series
              The Harry Potter series consists of seven books, published between 1997 and 2007. The books chronicle the life and adventures of Harry Potter, a young wizard who learns on his 11th birthday that he is famous for surviving an attack from the dark wizard Voldemort. As Harry attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he makes close friends, discovers hidden aspects of his past, and ultimately battles Voldemort for the fate of the wizarding world.
